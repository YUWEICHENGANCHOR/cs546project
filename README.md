For this project we created a mock twitter website. The initial page brings a user to a login page, where they can log in if they have an account or sign up for one. Once they have logged in, they are brought to the homepage where they can view all the recent posts and create a new post. If a user clicks on a post, they are brought to a new page, where they can add comments to the post. Any comments made on a post will give a notification to the poster. There is a page with the user's profile, where the user can see all posts he or she has made. There is also a notification page that shows the user all recent notifications. And once the user is done browsing, they can logout.
